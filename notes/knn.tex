  Let's tackle the problem of discriminating between different
  disease vectors. Ideally, we'd like to have a simple test that
  tells us what ails us. One kind of test is mass spectrometry. This
  graph shows spectrometry results for two types of bacteria. There
  is plenty of variation within each type, both due to measurement
  error and due to changes in the bacterial strains. Here, we plot
  the average and maximum energies measured for about 100 different
  examples from each strain.

\only<article>{ Now, is it possible to identify an unknown strain
  based on this data? Actually, this is possible. Sometimes, very
  simple algorithms work very well. One of the simplest one involves
  just measuring the distance between the decsription of a new unknown
  strain and known ones. In this visualisation, I projected the
  1300-dimensional data into a 2-dimensional space. Here you can
  clearly see that it is possible to separate the two strains. We can
  use the distance to examples VVT and BUT in order to decide the type
  of an unknown strain.  }

  The choice of distance in this kind of algorithm is important,
  particularly for very high dimensions. For something like a
  spectrogram, one idea is look at the total area of the difference
  between two spectral lines.

  \frametitle{The nearest neighbour algorithm}
  \only<article>{The nearest neighbour algorithm for classification (Alg.~\ref{alg:kNN-classify}) does not include any complicated learning. Given a training dataset $D$, it returns a classification decision for any new point $x$ by simply comparing it to its closest $k$ neighbours in the dataset. It then estimates the probability $p_y$ of each class $y$ by calculating the average number of times the neighbours take the class $y$.

      \State \textbf{Input} Data $D = \{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_T, y_T)\}$, $k \geq 1$,  $d : \CX \times \CX \to \Reals_+$, new point $x \in \CX$
      \State $D = \texttt{Sort}(D, d)$ \% \textsf{ Sort $D$ so that $d(x, x_i) \leq d(x, x_{i+1})$}.
      \State $p_y = \sum_{i=1}^k \ind{y_i = y} / k$ for $y \in \CY$.

The model itself might be incorrect, but this should nevertheless be OK for our purposes. In particular, we might later use the model in order to derive classification rules.}
