\subsection{Statistical testing\textsuperscript{*}}
\only<article>{A common type of decision problem is a statistical test. This arises when we have a set of possible candidate models $\CM$ and we need to be able to decide which model to select after we see the evidence.
  Many times, there is only one model under consideration, $\model_0$, the so-called \alert{null hypothesis}. Then, our only decision is whether or not to accept or reject this hypothesis.}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Simple hypothesis testing}
  \only<article>{Let us start with the simple case of needing to compare two models.}
  \begin{block}{The simple hypothesis test as a decision problem}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\CM = \{\model_0, \model_1\}$
    \item $a_0$: Accept model $\model_0$
    \item $a_1$: Accept model $\model_1$
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{table}[H]
      \begin{tabular}{c|cc}
        $\util$& $\model_0$& $\model_1$\\\hline
        $a_0$ & 1 & 0\\
        $a_1$ & 0 & 1
      \end{tabular}
      \caption{Example utility function for simple hypothesis tests.}
    \end{table}
    \only<article>{There is no reason for us to be restricted to this utility function. As it is diagonal, it effectively treats both types of errors in the same way.}
  \end{block}

  \begin{example}[Continuation of the medium example]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\model_1$: that John is a medium.
    \item $\model_0$: that John is not a medium.
    \end{itemize}
    \only<article>{
      Let $x_t$ be $0$ if John makes an incorrect prediction at time $t$ and $x_t = 1$ if he makes a correct prediction. Let us once more assume a Bernoulli model, so that John's claim that he can predict our tosses perfectly means that for a sequence of tosses $\bx = x_1, \ldots, x_n$,
      \[
        P_{\model_1}(\bx) = \begin{cases}
          1, & x_t = 1 \forall t \in [n]\\
          0, & \exists t \in [n] : x_t = 0.
        \end{cases}
      \]
      That is, the probability of perfectly correct predictions is 1, and that of one or more incorrect prediction is 0. For the other model, we can assume that all draws are independently and identically distributed from a fair coin. Consequently, no matter what John's predictions are, we have that:
      \[
        P_{\model_0}(\bx = 1 \ldots 1) = 2^{-n}.
      \]
      So, for the given example, as stated, we have the following facts:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item If John makes one or more mistakes, then $\Pr(\bx \mid \model_1) = 0$ and $\Pr(\bx \mid \model_0) = 2^{-n}$. Thus, we should perhaps say that then John is not a medium
      \item If John makes no mistakes at all, then 
        \begin{align}
          \Pr(\bx = 1, \ldots, 1 \mid \model_1) &= 1,
          &
            \Pr(\bx = 1, \ldots, 1 \mid \model_0) &= 2^{-n}.
        \end{align}
      \end{itemize}
      Now we can calculate the posterior distribution, which is
      \[
        \bel(\model_1 \mid \bx = 1, \ldots, 1) = \frac{1 \times \bel(\model_1)}{1 \times \bel(\model_1) + 2^{-n} (1 - \bel(\model_1))}.
      \]
      Our expected utility for taking action $a_0$ is actually
    }
    \[
      \E_\bel(\util \mid a_0) = 1 \times \bel(\model_0 \mid \bx) + 0 \times \bel(\model_1 \mid \bx), \qquad
      \E_\bel(\util \mid a_1) = 0 \times \bel(\model_0 \mid \bx) + 1 \times \bel(\model_1 \mid \bx)
    \]

  \begin{definition}[Null statistical test]
    \only<article>{
      A statistical test $\pol$ is a decision rule for accepting or rejecting a hypothesis on the basis of evidence. A $p$-value test rejects a hypothesis whenever the value of the statistic $f(x)$ is smaller than a threshold.}
    The statistic $f : \CX \to [0,1]$ is  designed to have the property:
    \[
      P_{\model_0}(\cset{x}{f(x) \leq \delta}) = \delta.
    \]
    If our decision rule is:
    \[
      \pol(a \mid x) =
      \begin{cases}
        a_0, & f(x) \geq \delta\\
        a_1, & f(x) < \delta,
      \end{cases}
    \]
    the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true is exactly $\delta$.
  \end{definition}
  \only<presentation>{The value of the statistic $f(x)$, otherwise known as the \alert{$p$-value}, is uninformative.}
  \only<article>{This is because, by definition, $f(x)$ has a uniform distribution under $\model_0$. Hence the value of $f(x)$ itself is uninformative: high and low values are equally likely. In theory we should simply choose $\delta$ before seeing the data and just accept or reject based on whether $f(x) \leq \delta$. However nobody does that in practice, meaning that $p$-values are used incorrectly. Better not to use them at all, if uncertain about their meaning.}

    \item They ignore effect sizes. \only<article>{For example, a linear analysis may determine that there is a significant deviation from zero-mean, but with only a small effect size of 0.01. Thus, reporting only the $p$-value is misleading}
    \item They do not consider prior information. 
    \item They do not represent the probability of having made an error. \only<article>{In particular, a $p$-value of $\delta$ does not mean that the probability that the null hypothesis is false given the data $x$, is $\delta$, i.e. $\delta \neq \Pr(\neg \model_0 \mid x)$.}

  \frametitle{Concentration inequalities and confidence intervals}
  \only<article>{
    There are a number of inequalities from probability theory that allow us to construct high-probability confidence intervals. The most well-known of those is Hoeffding's inequality \index{Hoeffding inequality|textbf}, the simplest version of which is the following:
    \begin{lemma}[Hoeffding's inequality]
      Let $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ be a series of random variables, $x_i \in [0, 1]$. Then it holds that, for the empirical mean:
      \[
        \mu_n \defn \frac{1}{n} sum_{t=1}^n x_t
      \]
      \begin{equation}
        \Pr(\mu_n \geq \E \mu_n+ \epsilon) \leq e^{-2n\epsilon^2}.
        \label{eq:hoeffding}
      \end{equation}
    \end{lemma}
    When $x_t$ are i.i.d, $\E \mu_n = \E x_t$. This allows us to construct an interval of size $\epsilon$ around the true mean. This can generalise to a two-sided interval:
    \[
      \Pr(|\mu_n - \E \mu_n| \geq \epsilon) \leq 2e^{-2n\epsilon^2}.
    \]
    We can also rewrite the equation to say that, with probability at least $1 - \delta$
    \[
      |\mu_n - \E \mu_n| \leq \sqrt{\frac{\ln 2/\delta}{2n}}
    \]
