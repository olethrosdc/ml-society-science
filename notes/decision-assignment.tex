\citet{wang2017deep} published a study where they train a model to classify faces as heterosexual or homosexual. This was widely reported in the press as \emph{neural networks can tell if you're gay with 81\% accuracy.} Is this a correct interpretation? What are the conclusions you can actually draw from that study? In particular, how see page 16 in the study above as well as the author notes \url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/11oGZ1Ke3wK9E3BtOFfGfUQuuaSMR8AO2WfWH3aVke6U/edit#heading=h.azz3c29et2ox}

The authors are a bit unclear about their accuracy measure, but it
seems to be the area under the curve. For some more information, check
the work by \citet{bengio2005expected}. Is this a reasonable metric to
use for performance? Is it possible to extract the probability of the
model correctly classifying somebody as gay from the information given
in the paper?  What sources of bias might the study have?
