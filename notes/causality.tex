  \only<article>{Causal questions do not just deal with statistical relationships. The meaning of these questions is slightly different depending on whether we are talking about the population at large, or a specific individual. For populations, the main question is whether or not our actions have a causal effect. In observational data, we also need to consider the \emph{direction of causation}.}

  \only<article>{In order to be able to meaningfully talk about effects and causes we must also introduce decisions. Formally, there is nothing different in the decisions in this section and those introduced in Section~\ref{sec:decision-problems}. However, in this case we will try and use decisions to model outside interventions in a ``natural'' system, whereby a \emph{null} decision means that we do not intervene.}

  \frametitle{Overview}
  \begin{block}{Inferring causal models}
    We can distinguish different \alert{models} from observational or experimental data.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Inferring individual effects}
    The effect of possible intervention on an individual is not generally determinable. We usually require strong assumptions.
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{Decision-theoretic view}
    There are many competing approaches to causality. We will remain within the decision-theoretic framework, which allows us to crisply define both our knowledge and assumptions.

      \end{subfigure}
    \end{figure}
    Suppose we have data $x_{t}, a_{t}$ where
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{t}$: lung cancer
    \item $a_{t}$: smoking
    \end{itemize}
    Does smoking cause lung cancer or does lung cancer make people smoke? Can we compare the two models above to determine it?
  \end{example}
  \only<article>{The answer is no. Let us consider two different parametrisations of the distribution. One in which $a_t$ generates $x_t$, and the converse, for any given parameter value $\param$, as given below:}
  \uncover<2>{
    \[
    P_\param(D) =
    \prod_t P_\param(x_t, a_t)
    = 
    \prod_t P_{\param'}(x_t \mid a_t) P_{\param'}(a_t)
    = 
    \prod_t P_{\param''}(a_t \mid x_t) P_{\param''}(x_t).
    \]
  }
  \only<article>{In particular, for any parametrisation $\param$ of the joint distribution, there exists a $\param'$ and $\param''$ giving the same probabilities for all $x_t, a_t$. For the example above, we can look at Bernoulli distributions for both variables so that $P_\param(x_t = x, a_t = a) = \param_{x,a}$. Then
    \begin{align*}
      \param'_a &= \sum_x \param_{x,a},
      &
        \param'_{x|a} &= \param_{x,a} / \param'_a
      \\
      \param''_x &= \sum_a \param_{x,a},
      &
        \param'_{a|x} &= \param_{x,a} / \param''_x.
    \end{align*}
    This means we can define prior distributions $\bel, \bel', \bel''$ in these three parameter spaces that give exactly the same results, e.g. by modelling each parameter as an independent Beta distribution. So, clearly simply looking at a simple graphical model does not let us answer this question.}

\subsection{Decision diagrams}
\only<article>{
  However, graphical models \alert{can} be extended  to model causal relations. In particular, we can use \emph{decision diagrams}\footnote{Otherwise called influence diagrams}, which include not only random variables, but also \emph{decision} variables, denoted with squares, as well as utility variables, denoted via diamonds. In the following examples, we assume there are some underlying distributions specified by parameters $\param$, which we include in the diagrams for clarity. Even though it may seem intuitively sensible to suppose it, the arrow directions in the diagrams \emph{do not} indicate direct causes. The only important thing for determining whether some variable influences another is whether or not there is independence between the corresponding decision and random variables.}

      \begin{itemize}

  \begin{block}{The conditional distribution of decisions}
    \only<article>{If $\pol \in \Pol$ is a decision variable, we represent the conditional distribution of any random variable $a$ given $\pol$ simply as a collection of probability measures $\cset{\pol(a)}{\pol \in \Pol}$, one for each possible value $\pol$.

    \[
    \pol(a) \equiv \Pr^\pol(a) \equiv \Pr(a \mid \pol).

    \only<article>{The reader should note that the standard definition of a conditional distribution also $P(A \mid B)$ creates a collection of distributions on $A$, with elements $P_B(A)$. However, it also specifies a rule for doing so from the complete distribution $P$.

\subsection{Common structural assumptions}
\only<article>{
  In order to be clear about what constitutes an observation by the experimenter and what is a decision, we must clearly separate random variables from decision variables. The individual actions may be random variables, but they will depend on decisions taken. As we will see later, this is useful for modelling interventions.}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Basic causal structures}

    \index{policy!default}
    The space of policies $\Pol$ includes a \alert{default policy} $\pol_0$, under which the data was collected. \only<article>{The policy $\pol_0$ might already be known, if for example the data was collected with a specific algorithm. However, frequently $\pol_0$ is not given, and must also be inferred from the data. In that case, it can be seen as an additional parameter, complementary to $\param$.}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Intervention policies}
    \index{policy!intervention}
    Except $\pol_0$, policies $\pol \in \Pol$ represent different interventions specifying a distribution $\pol(a_t \mid x_t)$.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Direct interventions. \only<article>{The simplest scenario is when we are able to choose a $\pol$ for which we know $\pol(a_t \mid x_t)$. This counts as a direct intervention, as we can specify any distribution of actions allowed in $\Pol$. If $\Pol$ includes all conditional distributions, we can select an arbitrary action for every individual. This assumption is plausible for algorithmic decision making such as recommendation systems, but implausible when the actions are taken by another agent, such as a human.}
    \item Indirect interventions and non-compliance. \only<article>{In this scenario we assume that, while we are free to choose policies from $\Pol$, we do not know what distribution $\pol(a_t \mid x_t)$ each policy specifies. In algorithmic decision making, this occurs whenever $\pol$ represents hyperparameters and algorithms for which we have insufficient information. Then policies must be evaluated through some type of black-box (e.g. A/B) testing. When the actions are taken by (human) agents, the policy implies making a recommendation, which may not be followed by the agent. If we denote the recommendation by $v_t$, then we can write $\pol(a_t \mid x_t) = \sum_{z_t} \pol(a_t \mid z_t, x_t) \pol(z_t \mid x_t)$. In this scenario we can freely specify $\pol(z_t \mid x_t)$, but $\pol(a_t \mid z_t, x_t)$ must be estimated. For that reason, it is usually simpler to simply marginalise out $a_t$. But perhaps the simplest approach is to consider non-compliance as a confounder $x_t$, and $z_t$ as an instrumental variable. }

Under the default policy $\pol_0$, their actions are determined only the individuals. Consider an alternative policy $\pol$, which prescribes diet and exercise regimes. Due to non-compliance, actual actions taken by individuals may differ from prescribed actions. In addition, actions might not be observed.}

    Assume that $x \in \CX$, a continuous space, but $y \in \CY$ is discrete. In this scenario, then the value of an action under a policy $\pol$ is nonsensical, as it does not really depend on the policy itself:

      Then, by estimating $\param$, we can predict the effect of any action.
      \only<article>{
        How can we estimate $\param$ from historical data? We simply have to select the right parameter value.
        Simply put, each choice of $a$ corresponds to one part of the parameter vector. This means that the maximum likelihood estimate 
        \[
        \hat{\param}_a \defn \frac{1}{|\cset{t}{a_t = a}|} \sum_{\cset{t}{a_t = a}} y_t
        \]
        is valid. We can also consider a product-Beta prior $\BetaDist(\alpha^0_a, \beta^0_b)$ for each one of the Bernoulli parameters, so that the posterior after $t$ observations is
        \[
        \alpha^t_a = \alpha^0_a + \sum_{\cset{t}{a_t = a}} y_t, \qquad
        \beta^t_a = \beta^0_a + \sum_{\cset{t}{a_t = a}} (1 - y_t).
        \]
        How can we optimise the policy? 
        Let us parametrise our policy with $\pol(a_t = 1) = w$.

        For a fixed $\param$, the value of the policy is
        \[
        \E^\pol_\param \util = 
        \param_1 w + \param_0 (1 - w)
        \]
        The gradient with respect to w is 
        \[
        \nabla \E^\pol_\param \util = 
        \param_1 - \param_0, 
        \]
        so we can use the update
        \[
        w^{(n+1)} = w^{(n)} + \delta^{(n)} \param_1 - \param_0.
        \]
        \alert{However}, $w \in [0,1]$, which means our optimisation must be constrained. Then we obtain that
        $w = 1$ if $\param_1 > \param_0$ and $0$ otherwise.

        When $\param$ is not known, we can use stochastic gradient descent.
        \index{gradient ascent!stochastic}
        \[
        \nabla \E^\pol_\bel \util = 
        \int_\Param [\nabla \E^\pol_\param \util] \dd \bel(\param)
        \]
        to obtain:
        \[
        w^{(n+1)} = w^{(n)} + \delta^{(n)} \param^{(n)}_1 - \param^{(n)}_0.
        \]

  \subsection{Exercises}
  In the following exercises, we are taking actions $a_t$ and obtaining outcomes $y_t$. Our utility function is simply $U = y_t$.
  \only<article>{
    \begin{exercise}
      Let us have some data generated from a null treatment policy $\pol_0$ of the form $(a_t, y_t)$. There is a simple model that explains the data of the form
      \[
      y_t \mid a_t = a, \param \sim \Normal(a + \param, 1),
      \]
      where the actions are distribution according to $\pol(a_t)$. 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Assume that $\pol_0 \in [0,1]$ is given and it is $a_t \mid \pol = \pol_0 \sim \Bernoulli(\pol_0)$. First, estimate $\param$. Then, calculate the distribution of $y_t \mid \pol_0, \param$ for any other policy and plot the resulting mean and variance as $\pol$ changes. You can do this first in a maximum-likelihood manner. Advanced: estimate the posterior distribution of $\param$ for a normal prior on $\param$.
      \item Now assume that $\pol_0$ is not given. This means that you must also estimate $\pol_0$ itself before estimating the effect of any other policy $\pol$ on the data.
      \item In this exercise, can you learn about other actions when you are not taking them? Why?
      \end{itemize}
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{exercise}
      Let us have some data generated from a null treatment policy $\pol_0$ of the form $(a_t, y_t)$. Let us now consider a slightly model where $\param \in \Reals^2$.
      \[
      y_t \mid a_t = a, \param \sim \Normal(\param_a, 1),
      \]
      where the actions are distribution according to $\pol(a_t)$. 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Assume that $\pol_0 \in [0,1]$ is given and it is $a_t \mid \pol = \pol_0 \sim \Bernoulli(\pol_0)$. First, estimate $\param$. Then, calculate the distribution of $y_t \mid \pol_0, \param$ for any other policy and plot the resulting mean and variance as $\pol$ changes. You can do this first in a maximum-likelihood manner. Advanced: estimate the posterior distribution of $\param$ for a normal prior on $\param$.
      \item Now assume that $\pol_0$ is not given. This means that you must also estimate $\pol_0$ itself before estimating the effect of any other policy $\pol$ on the data.
      \item In this exercise, can you learn about other actions when you are not taking them? Why?
      \end{itemize}
    \end{exercise}

    \begin{exercise}
      Given your estimates, find the optimal policy for each one of those cases. Measure the quality of this policy on
      \begin{itemize}
      \item The actual data you have already (e.g. using importance sampling)
      \item On new simulations (using the testing framework).
      \end{itemize}
      \emph{Advanced: The optimal policy when $\param$ is known is to always take the same action. Does that still hold when $\param$ is not known and you are estimating it all the time from new data?}
    \end{exercise}


    \begin{exercise}[Advanced]
      Let us have some data generated from a null treatment policy $\pol_0$ of the form $(x_t, a_t, y_t)$, with $a_t, x_t \in \{0, 1\}$.
      \[
      y_t \mid a_t = a, x_t = x, \param \sim \Normal(\param_{a,x}, 1),
      \]
      where the actions are distribution according to $\pol_0(a_t \mid x_t)$. 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Assume that $\pol_0$ is given and it is $a_t \mid x_t = x, \pol = \pol_0 \sim \Bernoulli(w_{x})$. First, estimate $\param$. Repeat your analysis.
      \item Now assume that $\pol_0$ is not given.  Again, repeat your analysis.
      \item Is there now globally better action $a_t$? Should it depend on $x_t$, like in the observed policy? Can you estimate the optimal policy?
      \end{itemize}
