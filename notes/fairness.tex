\section{Fairness in machine learning}

\only<article>{
  The problem of fairness in machine learning and artificial intelligence has only recently been widely recognised. When any algorithm is implemented at scale, no matter the original objective and whether it is satisfied, it has significant societal effects. In particular, even when considering the narrow objective of the algorithm, even if it improves it overall, it may increase inequality.

  In this course we will look at two aspects of fairness. The first has to do with disadvantaged populations that form distinct social classes due to a shared income stratum, race or gender. The second has to do with meritocratic notions of fairness.

  \frametitle{Bail decisions}
  \only<article>{
    For our example regarding disadvantaged populations, consider the example of bail decisions in the US court system. When a defendant is charged, the judge has the option to either place them in jail pending trial, or set them free, under the condition that the defendant pays some amount of bail. The amount of bail (if any) is set to an amount that would be expected to deter flight or a relapse.

\subsection{Fairness as independence}
\begin{frame}
  \only<article>{So how can we reframe the above fairness notions in a more precise way? Both of them involve conditional independence between $y, a$ and a sensitive attribute $z$, such as race. The first notion says that the actions of the judge (or equivalently, the scores of the algorithm) are \emph{calibrated} with respect to the outcomes. The second says that they are \emph{balanced}, so that were the outcome known to the judge, she would be making a decision independently of the defendant's race. Both of these conditions were discussed in a more restricted setting by }

    \begin{definition}[Calibration]
      A policy $\pol$ is calibrated for parameter $\param$ with respect to $z$ if
      \begin{equation}
        \Pr_\param^\pol(y \mid a, z) = \Pr_\param^\pol(y \mid a), \qquad \forall a, z.
        \label{eq:calibration}
      \end{equation}
    \end{definition}
    You will observe that calibration here means that
    \[
    y \indep z \mid a, \param, \pol
    \]
    i.e. that $y$ is independent of $z$ given the judge's action $a$, so the distribution of outcomes is the same for every one of our actions no matter what the value of $z$ is.
    \begin{example}
      Figure~\ref{fig:imrs} shows how actual recidivism ($y$) relates to risk scores ($a$) for different races ($z$). In that case, it is apparent that, at least approximately, $P(y \mid a, z) = P(y \mid a, z')$, so the COMPAS method satisfies calibration.
    \end{example}

    \begin{definition}[Balance]
      A policy $\pol$ is balanced for parameter $\param$ with respect to $z$ if:
      \begin{equation}
        \Pr_\param^{\pol}(a \mid y, z) = \Pr_\param^{\pol}(a \mid y), \qquad \forall y, z.
        \label{eq:balance}
      \end{equation}
    \end{definition}
    On the other hand, balance means that
    \[
    a \indep z \mid y,
    \]
    i.e. that $a$ is independent of $z$ given the true outcome $y$.\footnote{This definition only really makes sense when $y$ does not depend on $a$ at all. When this is not the case, it's easy to construct a random variable $y'$ that does not depend on $a$ so that $y$ can be written as a function $y(y', a)$. Then we can achieve balance with respect to $y'$.}
    \begin{example}
      Figure~\ref{fig:imrs-risk} shows how risk scores ($a$) relate to actual recidivism ($y$) for different races ($z$). In that case, it is apparent that, at least approximately, $P(a \mid y, z) \neq P(a \mid y, z')$, so the COMPAS method does not satisfy balance.

\subsection{Fairness as meritocracy.}
\only<article>{A different concept of fairness is meritocracy. For example, if one candidate for a job is better than another candidate, perhaps that candidate should be taken for the job.}


\begin{frame}

  \only<article>{Let us consider merit from the point of view of the decision maker, who can either hire $(a_t = 1)$ or not hire $(a_t = 0)$ the $t$-th applicant. If the applicant has characteristics $x_t$ and merit $y_t$, the DM's decision has utility $U(a_t, y_t)$. In order to model meritocracy, we assign an inherent \emph{quality} to $y$, expressed as an ordering, so that $U(1, y) \geq U(1, y')$ if $y \geq y'$. Assuming $P_\param(x_t, y_t)$ is known to the DM then clearly she should make the decision by solving the following maximisation problem:
  }
  \begin{block}{Meritocratic decision}
    \begin{align}
      a_t(\param, x_t) \in \argmax_a \E_\param(U \mid a, x_t)
      &=
        \int_\CY U(a_t, y) \E_\param(U \mid a_t, x_t) 
    \end{align}
  \end{block}
  \only<article>{ Here, the notion of meritocracy is defined through
    our utility function.  Although it would be better to consider the
    candidate's utility instead, this is in practice difficult,
    because we'd have to somehow estimate each individual's utility
    function.  Finally, we are taking the expectation here is because
    we may not know for certain what the quality attribute of a given
    person might be.  }
\end{frame}
\subsection{Fairness as similarity.}
\begin{frame}
  \only<article>{It makes sense to combine the idea of meritocracy with that of similarity. That is, similar people should be treated similarly. This means that we should find a policy $\pol$ that maximises utility $\util$ and makes similar decisions for similar people. 

    Let $\CX$ be equipped with a metric $\rho$, and let $D$ be a divergence between distributions, such as the KL-divergence. We can then formalise the above intuition as follows:}
  \begin{equation}
    D[\pol(a \mid x), \pol(a \mid x')]
    \leq 
    \rho(x, x').

    \end{equation}
  \end{block}
\only<article>{

  The practical problem in this framework is how to define the metric $\rho$ in the first place. A natural idea is to simply use the probability of $y$ as a metric. Then it doesn't matter how different $x, x'$ appear: the only important thing is how what is the distribution of $y$ implied by the different attributes. 

    \begin{block}{The metric $\rho$ in terms of the distribution $y \mid x$}
    Firstly, assume you somehow have some probability law $\Pr$ over the variables of interest. To fix ideas, let us consider the total variation norm and assume $y \in \CY$ takes a finite number of values. Then we can define the metric as
    \begin{align}
      \rho(x, x')
      &\defn \|\Pr(y \mid x) - \Pr(y \mid x')\|_1
      = \sum_{i \in \CY} \|\Pr(y = i \mid x) - \Pr(y = i \mid x')\|_1
    \end{align}
    \end{block}
  }
\end{frame}



\subsection{A unifying view of fairness}
\only<article>{In both cases, we defined conditional independence for a fixed probability distribution $P_\param(x,y,z)$ on the various variables. We also considered meritocratic fairness with respect to $\param$. First of all, we can simply define a function $F$ that measures the amount of fairness violation for a given parameter value. As an example, the deviation from calibration of a policy $\pol$ for a given parameter value $\param$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  F_{\textrm{calibration}}(\param, \pol)
  \defn
  \max_{a, z}
  \sum_i |\Pr_\param^\pol(y = i \mid a, z) - \Pr_\param^\pol(y = i \mid a, z')|
\end{equation}
Similarly, the deviation from calibration can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  F_{\textrm{balance}}(\param, \pol)
  \defn
  \max_{a, z}
  \sum_i |\Pr_\param^\pol(a = i \mid y, z) - \Pr_\param^\pol(a = i \mid y, z')|
\end{equation}
Finally, we can also create a deviation for the constrains in the maximisation problem of \eqref{eq:constraint-meritocracy}, so that
\begin{equation}
  F_{\textrm{merit}}(\param, \pol)
  \defn
  \exp\left(\rho(x, x') - \epsilon\right).
\end{equation}

If we the decision maker did not care about fairness, she could just maximise some utility function $\util$ of interest. In order to take fairness into account, we define the value of the policy to be a linear combination between the original utility and the fairness violation.
}

\begin{block}{The value of a policy}
  Let $\lambda$ represent the trade-off between utility and fairness.
  \only<article>{The combined value for a given parameter $\param$ is}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:combined-value}
    V(\lambda, \param, \pol) = \lambda \overbrace{U(\param, \pol)}^{\textrm{utility}} - \underbrace{(1 - \lambda) F(\param, \pol)}_{\textrm{fairness violation}}
  \end{equation}
\end{block}

\only<article>{
  \begin{remark}
    It is also possible to define the above problem in terms of a constrained optimisation
    \[
      \max\cset{U(\param, \pol)}{F(\param, \pol) \leq \epsilon}.
    \]
    The advantage of specifying just a single value function to maximise is that unconstrained problems are usually simpler to handle.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Bayesian fairness}
\only<article>{
  The previous section defined a simple universal framework for trading off utility and fairness in terms of an unconstrained optimisation problem. This involved defining the value of a policy for a given trade-off $\lambda$ and an underlying distribution with parameter $\param$. However, in a learning context this parameter cannot be assumed to be known. One solution to this problem is to assume a Bayesian approach and simply specify a subjective probability distribution $\bel$ over parameters. Typically, this would be calculated from a prior distribution and some available data. }
