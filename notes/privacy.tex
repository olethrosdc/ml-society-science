\section{Differential privacy}
\only<article>{While $k$-anonymity can protect against specific re-identification attacks when used with care, it says little about what to do when the adversary has a lot of power. For example, if the  adversary knows the data of everybody that has participated in the database,  it is trivial for them to infer what our own data is. Differential privacy offers protection against adversaries with unlimited side-information or computational power. Informally, an algorithmic computation is differentially-private if an adversary cannot distinguish two similar database based on the result of the computation. While the notion of similarity is for the analyst to defined, a common is to say that two databases are similar when they are identical apart from the data of one person.}

    \begin{remark}
      Any differentially private algorithm must be stochastic.
    \end{remark}

    To prove that this is necessary, consider the example of counting how many people take drugs in a competition. If the adversary only doesn't know whether you in particular take drugs, but knows whether everybody else takes drugs, it's trivial to discover your own drug habits by looking at the total. This is because in this case, $f(x) = \sum_i x_i$ and the adversary knows $x_i$ for all $i \neq j$. Then, by observing $f(x)$, he can recover $x_j = f(x) - \sum_{i \neq j} x_i$. Consequently, it is not possible to protect against adversaries with arbitrary side information without stochasticity.}

  \begin{definition}[Sensitivity]
    The sensitivity of a function $f$ is
    \[
    \sensitivity{f} \defn \sup_{x N x'} |f(x) - f(x')|
    \]
    \only<article>{
      If we define a metric $d$, so that $d(x, x') = 1$ for $x N x'$, then:
      \[
       |f(x) - f(x')| \leq \sensitivity{f} d(x, x'),
      \]
      i.e. $f$ is $\sensivity{f}$-Lipschitz with respect to $d$.
    }
  \end{definition}
  \begin{theorem}
    The Laplace mechanism on a function $f$ ran with $\Laplace(\lambda)$ is $\sensitivity{f} / \lambda$-DP.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    \begin{align*}
      \frac{\pol(a \mid x)}{\pol(a \mid x')}
      &=
      \frac{e^{|a - f(x')|/\lambda}}{e^{|a - f(x)|/\lambda}}
      \leq
      \frac{e^{|a - f(x)|/\lambda + \sensitivity{f}/\lambda}}{e^{|a - f(x)|/\lambda}}
        = e^{\sensitivity{f} / \lambda}
    \end{align*}

\begin{frame}
  Here let is assume $x_i \in [0, M]$ for all $i$.
  \begin{block}{Laplace in the local privacy model}
    The sensitivity of the individual data is $M$, so to obtain $\epsilon$-DP we need to use $\lambda = M / \epsilon$.

    The variance of $a$ is $M / \epsilon \sqrt{n}$.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Laplace in the centralised privacy model}
    The sensitivity of $f$ is $M / n$, so we need to use $\lambda = M / n\epsilon$.

    The variance of $a$ is $M / \epsilon n$.
  \end{block}

    Here we assume that we can answer queries $q$, whereby each possible answer $a$ to the query has a different utility to the DM: $\util(q, a, x)$.
    Let $\sensitivity{\util(q)} \defn \sup_{x N x'} |\util(q, a, x) -\util(q, a, x)|$ denote the sensitivity of a query. Then the following mechanism is $\epsilon$-differentially private.
  }
  \begin{definition}[The Exponential mechanism]
    For any utility function $\util : \CQ \times \CA \times \CX \to \Reals$, define the policy
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:exponential-mechanism}
      \pol(a \mid x) \defn \frac{e^{\epsilon \util(q, a, x) / \sensitivity{ \util(q)}}}{\sum_{a'} e^{\epsilon \util(q, a', x) / \sensitivity{\util(q)}}}
    \end{equation}
  \end{definition}
  \only<article>{
    Clearly, when $\epsilon \to 0$, this mechanism is uniformly random. When $\epsilon \to \infty$ the action maximising $\util(q,a,x)$ is always chosen.
