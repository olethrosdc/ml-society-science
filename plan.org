* Artificial Intelligence, Science and Society


- ECTS Credits: 5


** Course content

Classic approaches in data analysis are use a static procedure for both collecting and processing data. Modern approaches deal with the adaptive procedures which in practice almost always are used.

In this course you will learn how to design systems that adaptively collect and process data in order to make decisions autonomously or in collaboration with humans.

The course applies core principles from machine learning, artificial intelligence and databases to real-world problems in safety,
 reproducibility, causal reasoning, privacy and fairness.

** Prerequisites

*** Essential
- Mathematics R1+R2
- Python programming (e.g. IN1900 â€“ Introduction to Programming with Scientific Applications).

*** Recommended
- Elementary knowledge of probability and statistics (STK1000/STK1100)
- Elementary calculus and linear algebra (MAT1100 or MAT1110)

** Learning outcomes

There are two types of learning outcomes. Firstly, those that are the core of the course, and secondly methodologies that are used as part of the course.

Core learning outcomes:

1. Ensuring reproducibility in both science and AI development.
2. Recognising privacy issues and be able to mitigate them using appropriate formalisms.
3. Mitigating issues with potential fairness and discrimination when algorithms are applied at scale.
4. Performing inference when there are causal elements.
5. Developing adaptive experimental design protocols for online and scientific applications.
6. Understanding when it is possible to provide performance guarantees for AI algorithms.

AI learning outcomes:

1. Understanding how to use data for learning, estimation and testing to create reproducible research.
2. Understanding Bayesian inference and decision theory and being able to describe dependencies with graphical models.
3. Understanding neural networks and how to apply stochastic optimisation algorithms.
4. Understanding and using differential privacy as a formalism.
5. Understanding causal inference, interventions and counterfactuals.
6. Understanding the recommendation problem in terms of both modelling and decision making.

** Prerequisites


** Course content

The course is split in 6 modules, which should be taken in sequence.

Module 1. Reproducibility: bootstrapping, Bayesian inference, decision problems, false discovery, confidence bounds.
Module 2. Privacy: Databases, k-anonymity, graphical models, differential privacy
Module 3. Fairness: Decision diagrams, conditional independence, meritocracy, discrimination.
Module 4. The web: Recommendation systems, clustering, latent variable models.
Module 5. Causality: Interventions and counterfactuals.
Module 6. Adaptive experiment design: Bandit problems, stochastic optimisation, Markov decision processes, dynamic programming.

** Examination

There are 2 projects (formally take-home exams), split into 3 parts
each. Each one takes 2-4 hours and is partly done in a tutorial
session.

Each question is weighted equally in each home exam, so that by
correctly answering the elementary parts of each question, students
can be guaranteed a passing grade. Each exam counts for 40% of the
score. A final exam is also given by the students. This counts for
20% of the final score.

Criteria for full marks in each part of the exam are the following. 

1. Documenting of the work in a way that enables reproduction.
2. Technical correctness of their analysis.
3. Demonstrating that they have understood the assumptions underlying their analysis.
4. Addressing issues of reproducibility in research.
5. Addressing ethical questions where applicable, and if not, clearly explain why they are not.
6. Consulting additional resources beyond the source material with proper citations.

The follow marking guidelines are what one would expect from students attaining each grade. 


*** A 


1. Submission of a detailed report from which one can definitely reconstruct their work without referring to their code. There should be no ambiguities in the described methodology. Well-documented code where design decisions are explained. 
2. Extensive analysis and discussion. Technical correctness of their analysis. Nearly error-free implementation.
3. The report should detail what models are used and what the assumptions are behind them. The conclusions of the should include appropriate caveats.  When the problem includes simple decision making, the optimality metric should be well-defined and justified. Simiarly, when well-defined optimality criteria should given for the experiment design, when necessary. The design should be (to some degree of approximation, depending on problem complexity) optimal according to this criteria.
4. Appropriate methods to measure reproducibility. Use of cross-validation or hold-out sets to measure performance. Use of an unbiased methodology for algorithm, model or parameter selection. Appropriate reporting of a confidence level (e.g. using bootstrapping) in their analytical results. Relevant assumptions are mentioned when required.
5. When dealing with data relating to humans, privacy and/or fairness should be addressed. A formal definition of privacy and/or should be selected, and the resulting policy should be examined.
6. The report contains some independent thinking, or includes additional resources beyond the source material with proper citations. The students go beyond their way to research material and implement methods not discussed in the course.

*** B

1. Submission of a report from which one can plausibly reconstruct their work without referring to their code. There should be no major ambiguities in the described methodology. 
2. Technical correctness of their analysis, with a good discussion. Possibly minor errors in the implementation.
3. The report should detail what models are used, as well as the optimality criteria, including for the experiment design. The conclusions of the report must contain appropriate caveats. 
4. Use of cross-validation or hold-out sets to measure performance. Use of an unbiased methodology for algorithm, model or parameter selection. 
5. When dealing with data relating to humans, privacy and/or fairness should be addressed. While an analysis of this issue may not be performed, there is a substantial discussion of the issue that clearly shows understanding by the student.
6. The report contains some independent thinking, or the students mention other methods beyond the source material, with proper citations, but do not further investigate them.
   
*** C

1. Submission of a report from which one can partially reconstruct most of their work without referring to their code. There might be some ambiguities in parts of the described methodology. 
2. Technical correctness of their analysis, with an adequate discussion. Some errors in a part of the implementation.
3. The report should detail what models are used, as well as the optimality criteria and the choice of experiment design. Analysis caveats are not included.
4. Either use of cross-validation or hold-out sets to measure performance, or use of an unbiased methodology for algorithm, model or parameter selection - but in a possibly inconsistent manner.
5. When dealing with data relating to humans, privacy and/or fairness are addressed superficially.
6. There is little mention of methods beyond the source material or independent thinking.

*** D

1. Submission of a report from which one can partially reconstruct most of their work without referring to their code. There might be serious ambiguities in parts of the described methodology. 
2. Technical correctness of their analysis with limited discussion. Possibly major errors in a part of the implementation.
3. The report should detail what models are used, as well as the optimality criteria. Analysis caveats are not included.
4. Either use of cross-validation or hold-out sets to measure performance, or use of an unbiased methodology for algorithm, model or parameter selection - but in a possibly inconsistent manner.
5. When dealing with data relating to humans, privacy and/or fairness are addressed superficially or not at all.
6. There is little mention of methods beyond the source material or independent thinking.

*** E
1. Submission of a report from which one can obtain a high-level idea of their work without referring to their code. There might be serious ambiguities in all of the described methodology. 
2. Technical correctness of their analysis with very little discussion. Possibly major errors in only a part of the implementation.
3. The report might mention what models are used or the optimality criteria, but not in sufficient detail and caveats are not mentioned.
4. Use of cross-validation or hold-out sets to simultaneously measure performance and optimise hyperparameters, but possibly in a way that introduces some bias.
5. When dealing with data relating to humans, privacy and/or fairness are addressed superficially or not at all.
6. There is no mention of methods beyond the source material or independent thinking.

*** F 

1. The report does not adequately explain their work.
2. There is very little discussion and major parts of the analysis are technically incorrect, or there are errors in the implementation.
3. The models used might be mentioned, but not any other details.
4. There is no effort to ensure reproducibility or robustness.
5. When applicable: Privacy and fairness are not mentioned.
6. There is no mention of methods beyond the source material or independent thinking.

** Motivation

Algorithms from Artificial Intelligence are becoming ever more complicated and are used in manifold ways in today's society: from prosaic applications like web advertising to scientific research. Their indiscriminate use creates many externalities that can be, however, precisely quantified and mitigated against.

The purpose of this course is to familiarise students with societal and scientific effects due to the use of artificial intelligence at scale. It will equip  students with all the requisite knowledge to apply state-of-the-art machine learning tools to a problem, while recognising potential pit-falls. The focus of the course is not on explaining a large set of models. It uses three basic types of models for illustration: k nearest-neighbour, neural networks and probabilistic graphical models, with an emphasis on the latter for interpretability and the first for lab work. It is instead on the issues of reproducibility, data colletion and experiment design, privacy, fairness and safety when applying machine learning algorithms. For that reason, we will cover technical topics not typically covered in an AI course: false discovery rates, differential privacy, fairness, causality and risk. Some familiarity with machine learning concepts and artificial intelligence is expected, but not necessary.

*** Module 1: Decision problems, probability and utility.

Reading: Chapter 1

Here the students get familiar with the concept of expected
utility. They perform simple exercises in python.  We define utility
in terms of the classification accuracy for individual decisions and
in terms of the generalisation performance in terms of choosing a
specific classifier model.

src/decision-problems/expected-utility.py

*** Module 2: Experiment design and decision analysis

Reading: Sec. 2.4.1, 2.2, 2.1, 2.6

This includes how data will be collected and processed, focusing on
automation of the process. I will encourage students to develop an
automated pipeline mainly through simulation, where all the variables
can be perfectly controlled. 

- Optimal decisions in continuous cases: stochastic gradient descent and Bayesian quadrature. 

*** Module 3: Bayesian inference

Reading; Sec 2.3

Introduction to BI through the meteorolgical prediction
problem. Dicsussion of simple conjugate priors (Beta, Normal). 


Day 1, Part 1
- Graphical model recap (5')
- Conditional probability (5')
- Bayes Theorem (5')
- Marginal distributions (5')
- The n-meteorologists problem (25')
Day 1, Part 2
- Suffficient Statistics / Conjugate priors (15')
- The Beta-Bernoulli conjugate pair (15')
- The Normal-Normal conjugate pair (15')

Day 2, Part 1
- Estimating which classifier is best (45')
-- Beta-Bernoulli (15')
-- Bootstrapping (15')

- Assignment 2 discussion (45')

*** Module 4: Bayes-optimal Decisions


Reading: Sec. 2.4-2.6, 4.1.3

- Bayesian decisions for models.
- Hypothesis testing: Hierarchical Bayesian models
- Contrast credible intervals with bootstrapping.

*** Module 5: Non-conjugate priors

Reading: None

Here we will focus on logistic regression as an example, the
module will be mainly practical and focus on TF probability.

See https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11819.pdf



*** Module 6: Databases and privacy

Reading: Chapter 3.

Introduction to databases, SQL and k-anonymity, consent, and the GDPR.
Various mechanisms for DP. Pointers to the opendp.org framework for differential privacy.
Comparison of various mechanisms in an ML task.

*** Module 7: Fairness

Reading: Chapter 4.

Introduction to fairness and condtional independence. Fairness as parity, balance, calibration, meritocracy or smoothness. Measuring conditional independence. Balancing performance with fairness constraints through constrained or penalised optimisation, or Bayesian methods.

*** Module 8: Latent variable models

Reading: Chapter 5.

Examples:
(a) Gaussian mixture model (b) epsilon-contamination model and outliers (c) preferences and attributes in recommendation systems

Practical work with Tensorflow probability, including outlier detection etc.

*** Module 9: Causality

Reading: Chapter 6.

Confounders, Instrumental variables, Interventions, Counterfactuals.
Hands-on: Importance sampling for estimating the impact of decisions.
Lab: tfcausalimpact

*** Module 10: Adaptive experiment design

Reading: Chapter 7.

Here we discuss experiment design in the adaptive setting, where our future experiments depend on data we have not seen yet. Two interesting cases are bandits (e.g. for recommendation systems) and active learning (e.g. for classification).
